# Over the Pan

A for-fun project that synchornize and backup data from Sina Weibo(新浪微博).

## To-do list
* Make synchornization recurring (Acess tokens are only valid for 24hrs and are not auto-renewable)
* Integrate Amazon S3 to store images
* Exception and error handling when calling Sina's API
* Put some make-up on this app...
* Pagination seems necessary...very
